Did you know this before ?
You may beleive these or not, but you can't deny that all countries are facing economic consequences due to high inflation in 2022. Well, as I studied two major reason for high inflation all over the world in 2022 are - 
- Covid 19 pandemic.
- Russia vs. Ukraine war.

The second reason affected me badly (that's my personal story, how I survived in Russia). 

So, as a normal consumer and  **as a data analyst** I decided to make a report on inflation of world's leading countries by GDP share. I gathered some data and now want to make a report to see the inflation in top 20 countries from 1993 to 2022.

Below is the final report. See the interactive dashboard in Tableau Public.

This dashboard basically shows the following insights
- Inflation of a selected country from 1993 to 2021.
- Inflation of top 20 countries in a selected year. 
- Recent inflation of a country in 2022. Is it higher than all time average ? Is it higher than expected ? 
- Countries having higher inflation than expected. 

## Well, now lets move to technical reports- how I did it?
The project is completed in 4 steps using 
**Excel Power Query** - for data extraction and cleaning.
**Python and Pandas** - for data transformation.
**Tableau Desktop** - for designing the dashboard.
#### Let's discuss the process step by step.
### 1. Data extraction and cleaning.
### 2. Data Transformation.
### 3. Time Series forecasting.
### 4. Dashboarding.
